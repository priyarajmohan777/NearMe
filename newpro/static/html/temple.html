<li> Vadapalani Murugan Temple is a graceful Hindu temple built around 125 years ago. Since the idol of Lord Muruga is the same as in Palani temple which is located in the Southern part of the state, it is known as Vadapalani Temple which means Northern Palani Temple.</li>
<li>The temple started initially as a thatched hut where Murugan's ardent devotee Annaswami Nayakar kept a portrait of the God and worshipped him. The temple was built on the same site as the thatched hut around 1890.</li>
<li>Vadapalani temple represents the grandiose culture of the Hindus which has several shrines of Lord Ganesha, Goddess Meenakshi Amman, Lord Shiva, Goddess Kali, Lord Bhairava, Chokkanadar, Dakshniamurti, Chandikeswara and Mahalakshmi. Lord Ganesha appears as Varasidhi Vinayagar at the left of the southern or the main entrance.</li>
<li>The belief is very strong here that people who cannot undertake the pilgrimage to the Palani temple can visit the Vadapalani temple with their offerings. Palaniandavar showers devotees with his blessings just the same as in Southern Palani. His grace resolves all issues for devotees, and they believe in the power of this sacred temple. </li>
